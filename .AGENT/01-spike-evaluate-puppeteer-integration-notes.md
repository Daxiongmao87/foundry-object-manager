# SPIKE Progress Notes: Evaluate Puppeteer integration with FoundryVTT server

## Day 1: Initial Investigation
- Confirmed FoundryVTT server can be started locally (manual test)
- Puppeteer dependency is available and compatible with Node.js
- FoundryVTT game loads at http://localhost:30000/game by default

## Next Steps
- Write a minimal Puppeteer script to connect to the running FoundryVTT server
- Attempt to execute a validation command in the browser context (e.g., Item.create({name: 'Test'}, {validateOnly: true}))
- Document any issues with authentication, loading, or browser context

## Blockers
- None so far
