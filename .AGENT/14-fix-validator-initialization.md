# STORY: Fix Validator Initialization Failure

## Description
After a world is successfully activated, the `FoundryPuppeteerValidator` fails to initialize, throwing a "Game context failed to initialize" error. This prevents any validation from occurring. This story is to debug and fix the validator initialization process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The `FoundryPuppeteerValidator` successfully initializes after a world is activated.
- [ ] The `test-basic-functionality.mjs` test runs to completion and successfully validates a sample object.
- [ ] The "Game context failed to initialize" error is eliminated.

## Tasks
1.  Investigate the `FoundryPuppeteerValidator.initialize` method to understand why the game context is not available after world activation.
2.  Add debugging and logging to the validator to trace the initialization flow.
3.  Implement a fix to ensure the validator waits for the game context to be fully available before proceeding.
4.  Run `test-basic-functionality.mjs` to verify the fix.
