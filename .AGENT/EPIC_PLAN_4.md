# Epic Plan 4: Documentation Update and Accuracy
## Epic Title
Complete Documentation Overhaul to Match Current Implementation

### Description
The current README.md and documentation are severely outdated and contain incorrect information about CLI usage, features, and setup procedures. This epic will bring all documentation up to date with the current Puppeteer-based implementation, including all new features like image validation, CRUD operations, and credential management.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] README.md accurately reflects current CLI interface and all available options
- [ ] All command examples in documentation work correctly with current implementation
- [ ] New features (image validation, CRUD, credentials) are properly documented
- [ ] Installation and setup instructions are current and accurate
- [ ] Help output matches documented examples
- [ ] Outdated references and incorrect flags are removed
- [ ] Documentation includes practical usage scenarios and workflows
