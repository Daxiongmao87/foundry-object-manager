# STORY: Final Epic Validation and Cleanup

## Description
This story is to validate that all the acceptance criteria of the epic "Refactor foundry-object-manager to use Puppeteer for Real FoundryVTT Validation" have been met. This includes a final review of the codebase to ensure all mocking code is removed, all tests are passing, and the documentation is up-to-date.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All acceptance criteria from the Epic are met.
- [ ] A final pass on the codebase has been done to remove any remaining dead code or comments related to the old implementation.
- [ ] The `EPIC_PLAN.md` is updated with the final status.

## Tasks
1.  Review all acceptance criteria from the `EPIC_PLAN.md` and verify they are completed.
2.  Run all tests to ensure they pass with the new Puppeteer implementation.
3.  Manually test the CLI functionality to ensure it remains identical for the end user.
4.  Perform a final code review to identify and remove any remaining mocking code, fallback systems, or other obsolete files.
5.  Update the `EPIC_PLAN.md` to mark all acceptance criteria as complete.
