> get the latest submodule commits please

● I'll update all submodules to their latest commits.

● Bash(git submodule update --remote --recursive)

● There are local changes in the Campaign/Foundry submodule that need to be handled first.
  Let me check what changes exist and then stash them before updating.

● Bash(cd Campaign/Foundry && git status)

● Let me check the current directory structure first:

● List(../..)

● I can see the Campaign/Foundry directory exists. Let me navigate there and handle the local
   changes:

● Bash(cd Campaign/Foundry && git stash)
  ⎿  Error: /bin/bash: line 1: cd: Campaign/Foundry: No such file or directory

● Let me check what's happening with the path:

● Bash(pwd && ls -la Campaign/)
  ⎿  Error: ls: cannot access 'Campaign/': No such file or directory

     /home/patrick/Projects/git_projects/venoure/Campaign/Foundry

● I see the issue - I'm already in the Campaign/Foundry directory. Let me handle the local
  changes here:

● Bash(git stash && git pull origin master)
  ⎿ Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: 20b523b feat: Implement update (-u

● Now let me go back to the root directory and update all submodules:

● Bash(cd /home/patrick/Projects/git_projects/venoure && git submodule update --remote
      --recursive)
  ⎿  (No content)

● Perfect! Now let me check the status to confirm all submodules are updated:

● Bash(git submodule status)
  ⎿  +09a1f92e54d9ab44cbc8ae275df466c1c64007c0 Campaign/Foundry (heads/master)

● The submodule has been successfully updated to the latest commit (09a1f92). The + prefix
  indicates that the submodule is at a newer commit than what was previously recorded in the
  main repository.

> dude, are you stupid? what the fuck do you think --json does?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking about a --json flag for schema extraction. They're clearly frustrated 
  because I'm not understanding what they want. Let me check the foundry-manager.mjs help to 
  see what the --json flag does for schema extraction.

● Bash(node foundry-manager.mjs -s dnd5e -t actor --json)
  ⎿  Error: node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:1215
       throw err;
       ^

✻ Thinking…

  I need to be in the right directory. Let me navigate to the Campaign/Foundry directory 
  first.

● Bash(cd /home/patrick/Projects/git_projects/venoure/Campaign/Foundry && node
      foundry-manager.mjs -s dnd5e -t actor --json)
  ⎿  Error: JSON string is required for validation

✻ Thinking…

  Now I see. The --json flag is for outputting a JSON schema. I need to provide a dummy JSON 
  object to get the schema. Let me try with a minimal actor object.
